It's a welcome attack on your senses. One is left with an orgasmic high after savouring all dishes. Each one of them is down to details with the flavours so apparent the moment the cutlery hits your mouth. From their appetisers to the main course to the desert. One is just begging for the gastronomy not to stop. It's not heavy at all and just about the right portion size. The one at DFL Cyber Hub hit the ball out of the park for sure. It's time to visit the Mumbai one to see if this outlet lives up to my expectations.

That's how I can simply define Farzi Cafe. It's already a sensation now. I really wonder whether my review is even needed now as the elitists are already loyal patrons and hooked to this laboratory which excels and stands apart in molecular gastronomy!\n\nWe visited recently, on a Monday evening and as expected, it was packed with food lovers and only 2 or 3 tables were vacant!\n\nThe ambience is classy and the cafe is dim lit which is the perfect setting to enjoy a peaceful dinner. But, the downside is that one can never get good pictures in such low lighting!\n\nThey have a huge and lavish menu but as suggested, we went for the Chef's special tasting menu and here's what all I would like to recommend -\n\n\u2b50 Mishti Doi Shots - Sweet curd condensed to form a thick jelly like texture which had to be gulped down at once! One of the most innovative welcome treats!\n\n\u2b50 Chai Paani - A vodka &amp; kahlua based cocktail infused with tea. It was a visual treat to watch this getting prepared! The taste was heavenly! It was served in a quirky kettle and I comfortably sipped this exotic cocktail throughout my meal!\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n\u2b50 Aaloo Bukhara Kale salad - Was next in line. Even though I am not a fan of Salads, the fresh and juicy Aaloo Bukhara along with Goat Chesse was irresistible!\n\n\u2b50 Masala Jackfruit Cigars with Tadka Mayo - Highly Recommended. Thin and super crispy sticks were made of Jackfruit and served with scrumptious Mayo which had been flavoured in house! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n\u2b50 Nizami Tarkari Biryani - All Biryani lovers, go for this one! You'll thank me later. Served with delicious Raita, it was the perfect main course of the day!\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n\u2b50 Matka Cholle Lucchi Puff - The modern day Cholle Bhature! The puffs or Bhature were palm sized and thanks to their size, we could devour the entire portion! The Cholle were cooked to perfection! Balanced spices and full of flavour!\ud83d\udd25\n\n\u2b50 Desi Chowmein - Topped with crunchy and saucy dry Chatpati Sev! Innovation at it's peak!\ud83d\udd25\n\n\u2b50 Ratatoville Gujia - An appetizer in the form of a Gujiya stuffed with Italian filling. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I could devour more than 20, if they would have served!\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n\u2b50 Dal Chawal Arancini - Another Wonder! Small round shaped balls were made out of Dal and Rice which were served with Papad! This dish hooked me to Farzi Cafe completely!\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n\u2b50 Chocolate Dirt Pile - We tasted the Ragi crispies but it was the Choco Dirt pile that stole the show! The key was to mess up the bowl as much as possible! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nWe were served a tangy lolipop after the Appetizers to clean our palate before the main course so that we could enjoy the best of both worlds!\n\nThe service was impeccable! The Chef served us all the dishes and explained the dietary benefits of everything, the method of preparation and the stewards were exceptionally attentive! The cafe was managed perfectly!\n\nDesi habshi highly recommends!

Having visited Farzi cafes in Bangalore and Mumbai I really wasnt expecting they would be able to surprise me here in Gurgaon but they did and how.\nThis place is all about Innovations in food and presentation. If you understand what flavours in a dish are and want to experience a rollercoaster ride in this culinary amusement world....this is a place to venture in.\n\nService: The service cannot get better and is nothing short of 5 star even though the place gets crowded. The staff is prompt and knows each and every dish very well. Subhod who served us along with the chef himself taking our orders ensured they explained each dish with the zeal its made.\n\nAmbience:\n\nVery elegantly done with an old and rustic feel. This place generally gets crowded with the IT crowd looking to unwind with colleagues so table booking is recommended even on weekdays. The DJ spins great english and occasional Hindi tracks. The volume is just right for one to have a conversation. So the field is well set for one to indulge in the culinary experience.\n\nCocktails:\n\nChuski Margarita: Margarita couldnt be better with amazing flavours of raw mango. To make you taste the flavours they present it with iced gola...couldnt get better.\n\nChai Pani: vodka and Kahlua based cocktail with tea infused in it. Tea connoisseur's must try.\n\nFood:\n\nYou are swept off your feet even before you start your meal with the welcome dish...we were served a unique version of Misti Doi.\n\nSoup: Cream Corn Chowder Bhutta wild greens. Amazing flavours and a must try.\n\nStarters:\nMushroom Falafel Donner. A must try for veggie lovers.\n\nChicken tikka cigars: Innovatively presented yet the flavours are amazingly induced.\n\nTandoori soy chops cheese and nut fudge: Another must try for veggie lovers and a local favourite.\n\nTahini cured country wings with tomato garlic chutney: Mildly flavoured and good for people who prefer less spice and pungent flavours.\n\nMains:\n\nMurg korma Biryani with peanut salan: chicken biryani very well flavoured with whole Indian spicies. Not oily and over flavoured....just the way it should be. The salan adds an extra touch of spiciness and can be added as per requirement.\n\nDesserts:\n\nWith so much food we really had to push ourselves for desserts but so glad we did.\n\nRas malai tres leches: A unique Rasmalai which is with Gajar Halwa and dipped in Safforn milk.\n\nParle G cheese cake: This one makes you rather nostalgic when you look at the Parle G biscuits and the cheese cake sandwiched between them. Rabri is the sauce its dipped in and leads to explosion of flavours.\n\n","reviewTime":"2018-05-17 12:13:32","reviewTimeFriendly":"25 days ago","timestamp":1526539412,"ratingColor":"305D02"},{"id":"35350864","userName":"Deepank Jain","rating":5,"rating_5":"5.0000","reviewText":"Worth every penny spent.Wow,realy it was different.vishal who was on our table was very helpfull in chosing dishes as it was Our first time.kudos to him.\n\n","reviewTime":"2018-05-15 14:14:42","reviewTimeFriendly":"27 days ago","timestamp":1526373882,"ratingColor":"305D02"},{"id":"35315796","userName":"Sameer Gupta","rating":4,"rating_5":"4.0000","reviewText":"Farzi Cafe won&rsquo;t let you down, definitely have to try it once for the Papdi chaat.

The only disappointment was the music being played out loud.\nOverall- a fantastic food joint with great service , good food and spectacular twist to the regular desi food.","reviewTime":"2018-04-17 16:51:18","reviewTimeFriendly":"one month ago","timestamp":1523964078,"ratingColor":"305D02"},{"id":"34689334","userName":"Priya","rating":4,"rating_5":"4.0000","reviewText":"I love this place, last time i was go there with my friend neha, we both are enjoying their food very much, it is delicious and also an attractive place to eat with friends","reviewTime":"2018-04-17 16:24:59","reviewTimeFriendly":"one month ago","timestamp":1523962499,"ratingColor":"5BA829"},{"id":"34680020","userName":"Alimpan De","rating":4,"rating_5":"4.0000","reviewText":"if you are looking for innovation, this is the place. starting from service to food to decor everything is great. the desi type chowmein (noodles) was mind blowing and the soya chap had the best after taste. icing on the cake was the rasmalai. it was innovative, creative and the most delicious\n\none piece of advise: please keep the volume down. the place was not filled and you had loud music which was not really useful!","reviewTime":"2018-04-16 23:48:35","reviewTimeFriendly":"one month ago","timestamp":1523902715,"ratingColor":"5BA829"},{"id":"34673050","userName":"That Veggie Blogger","rating":5,"rating_5":"4.5000","reviewText":"There are different things which I keep in mind while going out. Whether it is an official work or a leisure time out or going to a relative&rsquo;s house, there are different things which I always check. One of the most important in that category is food. Food is something which is always my priority no matter what I do or where I go. If I am stepping out of my premises, there should be good food in place.\n\nThe same is the story of every weekend. Sunday arrives and I plan a meal, preferably Lunch. Sometimes, it is with friends and sometime with family. The only constant in the ever changing plans is food. Food is one part of my life which will always be on my side as long as I crave for it. This particular time, I planned my lunch in Gurgaon as I was visiting my friends there. \n\nTwo of the most famous areas for food in Gurgaon are &ndash; Sec 29 market and Cyber Hub. I have been to both of them numerous times and loved both of them equally. A choice was to be made between two of them and believe me when I say it wasn&rsquo;t an easy one. I finally decided on Cyber Hub as it is just next to a metro station. You just have to take a few steps from IndusInd metro station and you will enter Cyber Hub.\n\nThere are a lot of choices In Cyber Hub. If you want are looking for Breakfast, you can go select IHOP. If Chinese is in your Mind, then Yum Yum Cha is the place for you. For full on Indian food, there can nothing be better than Made In Punjab. I went with Farzi Caf&eacute;. It comes highly recommended from the makers of Made In Punjab. Their Desi food with a twist makes them a force to reckon with.\n\nComing to the restaurant, it is right next to Made In Punjab which is from the same family as mentioned above. They even have Punjab Grill Tappa present in Cyber Hub. I went there for Sunday lunch at around 2 and they were almost full. I was lucky to get a seat at that time. They have a respectable seating of around 80 people at once. They have a dedicated bar present and are quite famous for their alcoholic drinks.\n\nComing to food department, we were served Amuse Bouche which is a rarity to see in NCR. It was given to prepare us for the mean. In desi term, it was Mishti Doi presented in a grand manner. Then there was Stuffed Mushrooms, Paneer Bhurji Taco and Aloo Gujiya. The mushrooms were fair in quantity as well as quality. Aloo Gujiya came in Paper Bag along with some complimentary plain Salted Wafers and and Sweet Chili Dip. Recommended. \n\nIn Drinks, there was Farzi Ok, Litchi Panna Desire and Italian Smooch. I specifically asked the server to make it a bit sweet. Not only did he oblige, but also he bought separate sugar syrup in case I wanted to add more. Nice gesture I must say. Farzi Ok was Orange based and Litchi Panna Desire was the best of all. Highly Recommended.\n\nIn Mains, there was Veg Biryani, Matka Chole Lucchi Puff and Pav Bhaji. All of them were ordered so that our Desi cravings can be satiated. Matka Chole Lucchi Puff can be easily called as Chole Bhature. Chole came in a Matka and were topped with raw onions. Bhature were very less oily which was helpful. Highly Recommended. Veg Biryani has Zucchini and Broccoli inside and was served with Salan and was really delicious. Recommended. But Pav Bhaji can be improved. Bhaji was just ordinary.\n\nIn Desserts, there were many eye catching options such as Parle G Cheesecake and Chocolate Dirt Pile but unfortunately both of them were with Egg. I went ahead with the sole Eggless Option in the form of Ras Malai Tres Leches, It was a normal Ras Malai stuffed with Carrot Cream and loads of gravy of Thick sweetened Pista Milk which was one of the best I have head. Highly Recommended.\n\nOverall, Farzi Caf&eacute; is a top choice if you are looking for some desi food but with a touch of difference. The Chef is to be credited with all the winning combinations. Recommended.","reviewTime":"2018-04-16 18:35:04","reviewTimeFriendly":"one month ago","timestamp":1523883904,"ratingColor":"3F7E00"},{"id":"34622040","userName":"Aman","rating":5,"rating_5":"5.0000","reviewText":"No doubt best place forever....\n\nNever disappointed till time...

Nice and huge Bar counter with apt sitting and perfectly made floor for Live performances. The quality of furniture that they have used is very nice and comfortable. Also the lighting gives you that classic pub feel.\n\nApart from the new Menu we had our favorite Mocktails i.e. Farzi OK (Orangle based) and Litchi Panna (Litchi and spices) which were perfectly made this time as well.\n\nThe new Menu had Paneer Bhurji Tacos: Had soft paneer cubes with red butter gravy on top a Methi thepla taco. Very tasty.\n\nMatka Chhole Luchhi Puff: Lucchi is fried bread popular in bengal. These were served with tangy preparation of Chhole inside earthern pot. Everything was cooked perfectly and spiced nicely.\n\nMutton Seekh: Looked like normal mutton seekh but was filled with drooling cheese in it. Amazing.\n\nDahi Murg: It had succulent pieces of soft chicken on bone in yello curd based gravy, It had a very different flavors and little tangyness.\n\nChhena nest with kesar milk: It looked like a bird's nest with ras malai as the eggs and served by puring rose petals and warm kesar milk on top of it. It was so yummy and good.
